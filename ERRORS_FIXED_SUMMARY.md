## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Supabase Database
Choose one option:

**Option A: Fresh Setup** (if no data to keep)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS applications CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS job_configs CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS jobs CASCADE;

-- Then paste entire supabase_schema.sql
```

**Option B: Migration** (if you have data)
```sql
-- See DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for full script
```

### 2. Verify Schema
```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'jobs';

-- Should see: slug, currency, salary_display, etc.
```

### 3. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev

# Test:
# 1. Create a job in admin panel
# 2. View job detail page
# 3. Submit application
# 4. Check admin panel for applications
```

### 4. Verify Storage Bucket
- Go to Supabase Storage
- Ensure `candidate-photos` bucket exists
- Set to public access for photo uploads
